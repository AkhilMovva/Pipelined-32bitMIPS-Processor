# Pipelined-32bitMIPS-Processor

- Microprocessor without Interlocked Pipeline Stages (MIPS) is a reduced instruction set computer (RISC) instruction set architecture (ISA) developed by MIPS Computer Systems which is now known as MIPS Technologies [1]. The early MIPS architectures were 32-bit, with 64-bit versions added later. This project is a computer aided digital design of a mini Microprocessor without Interlocked Pipeline Stages (MIPS) was implemented using VHSIC-Very High-Speed Integrated Circuit Hardware Description Language (VHDL) and results were simulated using Modelsim software.
